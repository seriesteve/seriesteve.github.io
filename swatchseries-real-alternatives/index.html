	<h1>Real alternatives to SWatchSeries.to (2021)</h1>
	<img class="w90" src="poster.jpg" alt="SWatchSeries is Down">
	<p>This 2021 started with bad news: swatchseries offline. Many of its users were forced to look for an alternative. If you are still looking, this list will help you.</p>
	<p>Here is a list of sites similar in use to SWatchSeries.to.</p>
	
	<h2>PutLocker</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="putlocker.png" alt="Putlocker Capture">
	<p>Putlocker is a perfect alternative for SWatchSeries. You can watch everything from the old classics to the latest releases on this site without paying a single penny or going through a bunch of reviews and ads.<br>
Putlocker is suitable for any mood; whether it be sad emotional movies or comedy series, every genre is available to watch.<br>
However, this website does not have any movies or TV series on its server but uses third parties for the same purpose.<br>
This website is very user-friendly, easy to use, and above all, it is free.<br>
	<a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://putlockers.fm/">Go to PutLocker</a></p>
	
	<h2>YSeries</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="Yseries.tv.png" alt="YSeries Capture">
	<p>This is yet another free to use site like Watch series that helps you watch a TV show or TV series online.<br>
Yseries has a wide variety of quality video sources in each source: dood, mixdrop, streamtape, upstream, mystream, abcvideo, etc. At first it can be confusing because it shows a few links on one side of the player, but there are usually many more below it.<br>
This site is also excellent for finding your favorite TV series. If you?re looking for a SWatchSeries alternative, be sure to give this one a try.<br>
	<a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://yseries.tv/home/">Go to YSeries</a></p>
	
	<h2>CmoviesHD</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="cmovieshd.png" alt="CmoviesHD Capture">
	<p>You can stream TV shows and popular movies from CMovies HD.<br>
The website's homepage is filled with TV series and films arranged in orderly according to their categories. Meanwhile, you can click the "TV-Series" tab to view all the available TV shows.<br>
You can quickly sort and filter the TV series based on its genre, country, release date, and quality of the show by clicking the "Filter" button. Furthermore, you can search directly for your preferred TV series by using the search bar.<br>
Also, you can see the famous and top-rated tv-series on the "Top IMDb" tab.<br>
	<a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://www1.cmovies.ac/">Go to CmoviesHD</a></p>
	
	<h2>IceFilms</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="icefilms.info.png" alt="IceFilms Capture">
	<p>The design of the site is very basic, with quite annoying banners. It seems to have admins that keep it updated, and listen to user requests. Like swatchseries they have varied fonts like mixdrop, dood, vidlox, etc.
	<br><a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://wwv.icefilms-info.com">Go to IceFilms</a></p>
	
	<h2>WatchSeries</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="wtachseries.png" alt="WatchSeries Capture">
	<p>Site with clean and simple interface. Easy to use. Since SWatchSeries has sources for mixdrop, streamtape, etc. But only one link per source. If the quality of a video fails, all the mirrors are usually the same.
	<br><a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://www3.watchseriess.co/">Go to WatchSeries</a></p>
	
	<h2>Final Considerations</h2>
	<p>All the listed sites are a real alternative to the old watch-series.to. Three stand out in similarity of use: Putlocker, Yseries and IceFilms. Happy marathon!</p>
