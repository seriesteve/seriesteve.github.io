	<h1>Torrent websites for TV Shows like YIFY (2021)</h1>
	<img class="w90" src="Logo-YTS.svg" alt="Yify torrents for TV Series">
	<p>Almost everyone knows YIFY (or YTS) and what it offers: movie 
	torrents, low size, easy to use, without costs. But what if I don't 
	want movies, but I want to get TV Shows. Well, here we review some 
	alternatives to Yts for TV series.
	</p>
	
	<h2>EZTV</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="eztv1.png" alt="EZTV Capture">
	<p>It is the first alternative that comes to one's head thinking 
	about YIFY. It is the source of TV shows used by the old PopcornTime. 
	The downside is that the interface is uncomfortable and some content 
	is missing. For example there are no episodes of "Friends".<br>
	<a class="btn" href="https://eztv.to/">Go to EZTV</a></p>
	
	<h2>RARBG</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="rarbg1.png" alt="RARBG Capture">
	<p>This site is more unspecific than the previous one, but it must 
	be on the list. It has both TV shows and movies, in addition to 
	other torrents. It is organized and somewhat more comfortable to 
	use than Eztv. One difference from Eztv is that it also contains 
	season packs, which makes it very convenient to download various 
	files from TV shows. Also, these packages are the best way to find 
	old content on the P2P network, Ex: "Friends".<br>
	<a class="btn" href="https://rarbg.com/">Go to RARBG</a></p>
	
	<h2>YSeries</h2>
	<img class="w90" src="Yseries1.png" alt="YSeries Capture">
	<p>A more enjoyable site, with a mobile interface. Like EZTV it is 
	specific to TV shows. Compared to RARBG it has a similar 
	organization, also containing packs. It is not my usefulness, 
	but also you can watch TV shows online. It is a more comfortable 
	place to decide which TV shows to download before starting to make 
	the popcorn.
	<a class="btn" href="https://yseries.tv/home/">Go to YSeries</a></p>
	
	<h2>Others sites</h2>
	<p>There are other sites that offer torrents, but are less specific or impractical for TV series: 1337x, ExtraTorrents, Torrentz, kat.sx, etc.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>We reviewed three TV show download sites similar to YIFY, all of 
	them useful and easy to use. Regarding content, in situations it is 
	common to use one or the other, if the required content is not 
	recent, Eztv is of little use. RARBG and YSeries have the greatest 
	variety in quality and size. The final recommendation is that you 
	add these three sites to your bookmarks and do not miss any part 
	of your favorite TV shows.
